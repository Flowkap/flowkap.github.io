title: Who I Am

---

I'm a software developer, nerd, husband, father, musician and bread lover
from south-west Germany. Born in the 90s — the glorious era of neon colors,
arcades and chunky videogame consoles —
I grew up surrounded by technology, music and a good dose of geek culture.

# What I do

Currently I work as a Software Architect at investify. Over the years
I’ve had an exciting journey through various roles, from electrical engineer
working on embedded systems for classic traffic management to Software Architect
of a modern FinTech cloud platform.
