A while back I stumbled upon the [**Engineering Ladders**](https://github.com/jorgef/engineeringladders) project by
[Jorge Fioranelli](https://github.com/jorgef), a thoughtful, open-source framework for defining what different levels
look like for engineers, tech leads, and beyond. It breaks down roles into clear expectations: scope, influence,
technical depth, people impact, and
more.Itâ€™s an awesome resource for teams, but when I tried to apply it to myself I wanted to fiddle

<strong>Why I Really Like This</strong>

One thing I see a lot â€” especially in interviews â€” is people saying *"Iâ€™m a senior engineer."* But what does that
actually mean? Itâ€™s definitely **not** just about coding for a certain number of years. Seniority shows up in what you
own, how you influence, how you help others grow, and how far your impact goes. Itâ€™s way
clearer to break that down than to just stick a label on someone.

I really like this tool because it makes that discussion practical. Instead of arguing about titles, I can ask a
candidate to map their ladder:

* How do you see yourself in Technology, System, People, Process, and Influence?
* What examples back that up?
* Where do you want to grow next?

This is so much better than just saying "Youâ€™re senior" or "Youâ€™re junior." It turns vague self-labels into a concrete
map of skills and impact, for candidates and for ourselves.

* A senior candidate can sketch their own chart before an interview.
* You can compare self-assessments with your teamâ€™s expectations.
* Or just help someone reflect: *Where am I strong? Where do I want to grow next?*

<strong>My Own Snapshot</strong>

When I ran my self-assessment, my radar landed around **Masters** on Technology, **Leads** on System, **Coordinates** on
People, **Defines** on Process, and **Multiple Teams â†’ Company** on Influence. Visualizing it this way immediately
showed me:

* Where Iâ€™m leaning more into org-wide impact.
* Where I could expand (e.g., mentoring other leads, not just engineers).
* And where my growth edges are next.

Itâ€™s way more motivating than reading a wall of text!

<strong>The Nerd in Me</strong>

For years, Iâ€™ve talked through these ladders verbally, in 1:1s, interviews, or mentoring sessions. But I always wanted
an **automated way** to generate these diagrams interactively.

Thanks to modern Python tooling (and a bit of AI help), this is easier than ever. I built a simple Python client for
generating Engineering Ladder radar charts, itâ€™s free and open source on my
repo: [**engineering-ladder-assessment** on GitHub](https://github.com/Flowkap/engineering-ladder-assessment)

I honestly donâ€™t know if thereâ€™s already something exactly like this out there, I just did it because it was fun,
useful for me, and maybe useful for you too.

ðŸš€ **Try It Yourself**

Give it a try, whether you want to map your own growth or assess candidates more meaningfully. Let it help you on your
journey, and see what insights come up. Give it a shot, Iâ€™m sure you wonâ€™t be disappointed!
