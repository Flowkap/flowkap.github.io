This is my first blog post on this site. Actually it's about how I set up this blog in the first place and why.

I'm going to switch job soon, and with it comes that I put a lot more on github lately than usual. Including some fun projects that I was asked about where the source is and so on. I wondered why not, purely for the sake of fun set up a blog?

I mean, I do know its not the most thrilling thing you can do in 2020 but maybe (I hope so) some of my former colleges will still follow me onwards after I left my current employer. And this might be a plcae for them to come from time to time. Who knows?

There where times before when I thought about doing this (especially after I started getting into Kubernetes) but I didn't feel like it at that time.

The more I work with open source though, the more I like the idea of sharing. I just never felt that what I do might be worth it (still don't think so to be honest) ... but maybe others thought the same? So why not start talking about things that I like here and link them together. Even if its only for my personal use. Probably it is ... but this brings me to one of the most thrilling things to me in open source:

<strong>"Someone did probably what you want to do before in a better way!"</strong>

And so it is like 99% of the times. As well as this time! I was sure about hosting at [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) straight away and was searching for a good template for a blog. Quickly I stubmled across [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) written by [Barry Clark](https://www.barryclark.co/). It looked exactly like what I was searching for but lacking a few features (like code highlighting styles) and I would've needed to tweak quite a lot.

Thanks to some other people on his Issue list I then found a fork [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) that has all of that.

And here we are. An hour or so later I have my stuff online. Isn't open source awesome? I certainly feel it is. And I actually hope to come up with something original at some point that other people like as much as I do like others stuff.
